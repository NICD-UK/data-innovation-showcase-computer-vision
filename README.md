# Data Innovation Conference
## Introduction to Computer Vision using Python
@ The Catalyst, Newcastle upon Tyne - 
September 27th, 2023

Have you ever wondered how an automated vehicle can read road signs or tell a pedestrian from a parked car? Or perhaps you've wondered how artificial intelligence can make diagnoses from medical scans or X-rays? How does the camera at the airport link your face to your passport? These are all applications of 'Computer Vision'. 

In this workshop, we will gently introduce you to Computer Vision, teaching your computer to learn how to identify items of clothing via a simple 'neural network'. We will be using an existing online dataset, the Python programming language and 'PyTorch', a framework for building deep learning models.

The aim of the workshop is to cover the following:

- G﻿et to grips with key terms in the field of deep learning with focus on computer vision​

- Practical application through demo that will cover:​
  - Data loading, exploration and preparation​
  - Modelling​
  - Evaluation​
  - Prediction​
  - Suggested improvements
